## Hi there 👋

I am Smitesh👋, I have 2 years of industry experience in Data engineering and Data Science.I have Work experience in collaboratively developing data warehousing solutions using SQL in Informatica PowerCenter, as well as in data visualization with Tableau. I am committed ✊ to building expertise in data analytics, statistical concepts, and industry-relevant engineering tools. Highly skilled in deep learning libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and others. Currently, I am working with Orcawise and developing a custom NLU system.


## About me 

- ✒️ As long as data is involved in a problem statement, I will dive deep to solve it!
- 🔭 I’m currently working with Orcawise[https://orcawise.com/] as a Data Science Intern and looking for full time opportunities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure services for data engineering and preparing for Azure Data Engineer Associate Exam.

# General Idea on my pinned projects

## 1. Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-For-Solar-Site-Selection  :
# Tech Stack : [QGIS, PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, Searborn, Spacy, LaTEX, GeoPandas, ,API services for data]

- Utilized geospatial data to select optimal sites for solar energy projects, leveraging advanced deep learning technique.
- Analysed Geological Information Systems (GIS) data and developed a machine learning pipeline that involved preprocessing GIS data from multiple web databases, modeling the data, and staging it for input into a deep learning model.
- Developed a multi-input Auto-Encoder to learn representations from geospatial data and applied various clustering algorithms to cluster optimal solar locations.
